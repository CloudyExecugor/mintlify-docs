<Info>
  **You can skip that part, if you are only interested in internal Injection**

### Main function setup

make the Api register itself on startup

```csharp
static myexecutor() {
	Api.External.RegisterExecutor("your-executor-name");
}
```

you can also put that in your Form1_Load() function.

<Tip>
  This function configures the UserAgent and Injection message to your custom name.
