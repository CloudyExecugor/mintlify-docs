## Welcome to Cloudy API

Cloudy API is a powerful toolkit built to enhance your interaction with Roblox processes, offering seamless internal and external execution, auto-injection, and advanced functionality such as DLL loading and version compatibility checks.

This API is designed for developers building custom tools, launchers, or executors, and integrates deeply with both Roblox and your own apps. It also includes built-in communication with a custom AI backend for real-time feedback and actions.

## Key Features

- 🔁 **Auto-injection** into Roblox processes  
- 🧠 **Ai.Ask / AskAsync** methods for intelligent scripting support  
- 🧩 **DLL Loader** support  
- 📦 **Roblox version checking** and update handling  
- 👤 **Avatar fetching and player info tools**  
- 🔐 **Internal execution** via `Api.Internal.inject()` (Admin-only)  
- 🧪 **External execution** for scripts, modules, and routines  

## Admin Privileges Required

To use certain internal methods like `Api.Internal.inject()`, your project **must** be granted Admin privileges. This allows the API to perform critical tasks like memory writing, process access, and other sensitive operations that are essential for internal injection.

If you don't have Admin access on the target environment, `Api.Internal` methods will not be available and will throw a permission error.
